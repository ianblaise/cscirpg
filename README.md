RPG Game for CSCI-41

For map creation here are the current buttons (probably will change..) this is just sort of slopped together so yeeeh.

r) makes rock
w) makes water
.) makes land
$) makes treasure
q) quits, then lets you choose file name to save map.

When this project gets further along we will add stuff like m makes monsters etc.. but right now you can create maps, save them and load them. So, progress was made today lol.
